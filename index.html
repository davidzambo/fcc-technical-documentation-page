                <li><h4>100 Continue</h4>
                    <p>The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request
                        body (in
                        the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). Sending a
                        large
                        request body to a server after a request has been rejected for inappropriate headers would be
                        inefficient. To have a server check the request's headers, a client must send Expect:
                        100-continue as a
                        header in its initial request and receive a 100 Continue status code in response before sending
                        the
                        body. If the client receives an error code such as 403 (Forbidden) or 405 (Method Not Allowed)
                        then it
                        shouldn't send the request's body. The response 417 Expectation Failed indicates that the
                        request should
                        be repeated without the Expect header as it indicates that the server doesn't support
                        expectations (this
                        is the case, for example, of HTTP/1.0 servers).[5]
                    </p></li>
                <li><h4>101 Switching Protocols</h4>
                    <p>The requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server has agreed to do so.[6]
                    </p></li>
                <li><h4>102 Processing</h4>
                    <p>A WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, requiring a long time
                        to
                        complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the
                        request,
                        but no response is available yet.[7] This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the
                        request
                        was lost.
                    </p></li>
                <li><h4>103 Early Hints</h4>
                    <p>Used to return some response headers before final HTTP message.</p></li>

                <li><h4>200 OK</h4>
                    <p>Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request
                        method
                        used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested
                        resource. In
                        a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the
                        action.[9]</p></li>
                <li><h4>201 Created</h4>
                    <p>The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.[10]</p></li>
                <li><h4>202 Accepted</h4>
                    <p>The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The
                        request
                        might or might not be eventually acted upon, and may be disallowed when processing
                        occurs.[11]</p></li>
                <li><h4>203 Non-Authoritative Information (since HTTP/1.1)</h4>
                    <p>The server is a transforming proxy (e.g. a Web accelerator) that received a 200 OK from its
                        origin, but
                        is returning a modified version of the origin's response.[12][13]</p></li>
                <li><h4>204 No Content</h4>
                    <p>The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.[14]</p></li>
                <li><h4>205 Reset Content</h4>
                    <p>The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content. Unlike a 204
                        response,
                        this response requires that the requester reset the document view.[15]</p></li>
                <li><h4>206 Partial Content (RFC 7233)</h4>
                    <p>The server is delivering only part of the resource (byte serving) due to a range header sent by
                        the
                        client. The range header is used by HTTP clients to enable resuming of interrupted downloads, or
                        split a
                        download into multiple simultaneous streams.[16]
                    </p></li>
                <li><h4>207 Multi-Status (WebDAV; RFC 4918)</h4>
                    <p>The message body that follows is by default an XML message and can contain a number of separate
                        response
                        codes, depending on how many sub-requests were made.[17]</p></li>
                <li><h4>208 Already Reported (WebDAV; RFC 5842)</h4>
                    <p>The members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a preceding part of the
                        (multistatus)
                        response, and are not being included again.</p></li>
                <li><h4>226 IM Used (RFC 3229)</h4>
                    <p>The server has fulfilled a request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the
                        result
                        of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.[18]</p></li>

                    <p>Indicates multiple options for the resource from which the client may choose (via agent-driven
                        content
                        negotiation). For example, this code could be used to present multiple video format options, to
                        list
                        files with different filename extensions, or to suggest word-sense disambiguation.[20]</p></li>
                <li><h4>301 Moved Permanently</h4>
                    <p>This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.[21]</p></li>
                <li><h4>302 Found</h4>
                    <p>Tells the client to look at (browse to) another url. 302 has been superseded by 303 and 307. This
                        is an
                        example of industry practice contradicting the standard. The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945)
                        required
                        the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was "Moved
                        Temporarily"),[22]
                        but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore,
                        HTTP/1.1
                        added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours.[23] However, some Web
                        applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.[24]</p></li>
                <li><h4>303 See Other (since HTTP/1.1)</h4>
                    <p>The response to the request can be found under another URI using the GET method. When received in
                        response to a POST (or PUT/DELETE), the client should presume that the server has received the
                        data and
                        should issue a new GET request to the given URI.[25]</p></li>
                <li><h4>304 Not Modified (RFC 7232)</h4>
                    <p>Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request
                        headers
                        If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match. In such case, there is no need to retransmit the resource
                        since the
                        client still has a previously-downloaded copy.[26]</p></li>
                <li><h4>305 Use Proxy (since HTTP/1.1)</h4>
                    <p>The requested resource is available only through a proxy, the address for which is provided in
                        the
                        response. Many HTTP clients (such as Mozilla[27] and Internet Explorer) do not correctly handle
                        responses with this status code, primarily for security reasons.[28]</p></li>
                <li><h4>306 Switch Proxy</h4>
                    <p>No longer used. Originally meant "Subsequent requests should use the specified proxy."[29]
                    </p></li>
                <li><h4>307 Temporary Redirect (since HTTP/1.1)</h4>
                    <p>In this case, the request should be repeated with another URI; however, future requests should
                        still use
                        the original URI. In contrast to how 302 was historically implemented, the request method is not
                        allowed
                        to be changed when reissuing the original request. For example, a POST request should be
                        repeated using
                        another POST request.[30]
                    </p></li>
                <li><h4>308 Permanent Redirect (RFC 7538)</h4>
                    <p>The request and all future requests should be repeated using another URI. 307 and 308 parallel
                        the
                        behaviors of 302 and 301, but do not allow the HTTP method to change. So, for example,
                        submitting a form
                        to a permanently redirected resource may continue smoothly.[31]</p></li>

                <li><h4>400 Bad Request</h4>
                    <p>The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g.,
                        malformed
                        request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request
                        routing).[33]</p></li>
                <li><h4>401 Unauthorized (RFC 7235)</h4>
                    <p>Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed
                        or has
                        not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a
                        challenge
                        applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access
                        authentication.[34] 401 semantically means "unauthenticated",[35] i.e. the user does not have
                        the
                        necessary credentials.
                        Note: Some sites issue HTTP 401 when an IP address is banned from the website (usually the
                        website
                        domain) and that specific address is refused permission to access a website.</p></li>
                <li><h4>402 Payment Required</h4>
                    <p>Reserved for future use. The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some
                        form of
                        digital cash or micropayment scheme, as proposed for example by GNU Taler[36], but that has not
                        yet
                        happened, and this code is not usually used. Google Developers API uses this status if a
                        particular
                        developer has exceeded the daily limit on requests.[37]</p></li>
                <li><h4>403 Forbidden</h4>
                    The request was valid, but the server is refusing action. The user might not have the necessary
                    permissions
                    for a resource, or may need an account of some sort.</p></li>
                <li><h4>404 Not Found</h4>
                    <p>The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests
                        by the
                        client are permissible.</p></li>
                <li><h4>405 Method Not Allowed</h4>
                    <p>A request method is not supported for the requested resource; for example, a GET request on a
                        form that
                        requires data to be presented via POST, or a PUT request on a read-only resource.</p></li>
                <li><h4>406 Not Acceptable</h4>
                    <p>The requested resource is capable of generating only content not acceptable according to the
                        Accept
                        headers sent in the request.[38] See Content negotiation.</p></li>
                <li><h4>407 Proxy Authentication Required (RFC 7235)</h4>
                    <p>The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy.[39]</p></li>
                <li><h4>408 Request Timeout</h4>
                    <p>The server timed out waiting for the request. According to HTTP specifications: "The client did
                        not
                        produce a request within the time that the server was prepared to wait. The client MAY repeat
                        the
                        request without modifications at any later time."[40]</p></li>
                <li><h4>409 Conflict</h4>
                    <p>Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the request, such as an
                        edit
                        conflict between multiple simultaneous updates.</p></li>
                <li><h4>410 Gone</h4>
                    <p>Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again.
                        This should
                        be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon
                        receiving
                        a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource in the future. Clients such as
                        search
                        engines should remove the resource from their indices.[41] Most use cases do not require clients
                        and
                        search engines to purge the resource, and a "404 Not Found" may be used instead.</p></li>
                <li><h4>411 Length Required</h4>
                    <p>The request did not specify the length of its content, which is required by the requested
                        resource.[42]</p></li>
                <li><h4>412 Precondition Failed (RFC 7232)</h4>
                    <p>The server does not meet one of the preconditions that the requester put on the request.[43]</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>413 Payload Too Large (RFC 7231)</h4>
                    <p>The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process. Previously called "Request
                        Entity
                        Too Large".[44]</p></li>
                <li><h4>414 URI Too Long (RFC 7231)</h4>
                    <p>The URI provided was too long for the server to process. Often the result of too much data being
                        encoded
                        as a query-string of a GET request, in which case it should be converted to a POST request.[45]
                        Called
                        "Request-URI Too Long" previously.[46]</p></li>
                <li><h4>415 Unsupported Media Type</h4>
                    <p>The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support. For example,
                        the
                        client uploads an image as image/svg+xml, but the server requires that images use a different
                        format.</p></li>
                <li><h4>416 Range Not Satisfiable (RFC 7233)</h4>
                    <p>The client has asked for a portion of the file (byte serving), but the server cannot supply that
                        portion.
                        For example, if the client asked for a part of the file that lies beyond the end of the
                        file.[47] Called
                        "Requested Range Not Satisfiable" previously.[48]</p></li>
                <li><h4>417 Expectation Failed</h4>
                    <p>The server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field.[49]</p></li>
                <li><h4>418 I'm a teapot (RFC 2324, RFC 7168)</h4>
                    <p>This code was defined in 1998 as one of the traditional IETF April Fools' jokes, in RFC 2324,
                        Hyper Text
                        Coffee Pot Control Protocol, and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers. The
                        RFC
                        specifies this code should be returned by teapots requested to brew coffee.[50] This HTTP status
                        is used
                        as an Easter egg in some websites, including Google.com.[51][52]</p></li>
                <li><h4>421 Misdirected Request (RFC 7540)</h4>
                    <p>The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response[53] (for example
                        because of
                        connection reuse).[54]</p></li>
                <li><h4>422 Unprocessable Entity (WebDAV; RFC 4918)</h4>
                    <p>The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors.[17]</p></li>
                <li><h4>423 Locked (WebDAV; RFC 4918)</h4>
                    <p>The resource that is being accessed is locked.[17]</p></li>
                <li><h4>424 Failed Dependency (WebDAV; RFC 4918)</h4>
                    <p>The request failed because it depended on another request and that request failed (e.g., a
                        PROPPATCH).[17]</p></li>
                <li><h4>426 Upgrade Required</h4>
                    <p>The client should switch to a different protocol such as TLS/1.0, given in the Upgrade header
                        field.[55]</p></li>
                <li><h4>428 Precondition Required (RFC 6585)</h4>
                    <p>The origin server requires the request to be conditional. Intended to prevent the 'lost update'
                        problem,
                        where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when
                        meanwhile a
                        third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict."[56]</p></li>
                <li><h4>429 Too Many Requests (RFC 6585)</h4>
                    <p>The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. Intended for use with
                        rate-limiting
                        schemes.[56]</p></li>
                <li><h4>431 Request Header Fields Too Large (RFC 6585)</h4>
                    <p>The server is unwilling to process the request because either an individual header field, or all
                        the
                        header fields collectively, are too large.[56]</p></li>
                <li><h4>451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons (RFC 7725)</h4>
                    <p>A server operator has received a legal demand to deny access to a resource or to a set of
                        resources that
                        includes the requested resource.[57] The code 451 was chosen as a reference to the novel
                        Fahrenheit 451 (see
                        the Acknowledgements in the RFC).</p></li>

                <li><h4>500 Internal Server Error</h4>
                    <p>A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific
                        message
                        is suitable.[60]</p></li>
                <li><h4>501 Not Implemented</h4>
                    <p>The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfil the
                        request.
                        Usually this implies future availability (e.g., a new feature of a web-service API).[61]</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>502 Bad Gateway</h4>
                    <p>The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream
                        server.[62]</p></li>
                <li><h4>503 Service Unavailable</h4>
                    <p>The server is currently unavailable (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance).
                        Generally, this
                        is a temporary state.[63]</p></li>
                <li><h4>504 Gateway Timeout</h4>
                    <p>The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the
                        upstream
                        server.[64]</p></li>
                <li><h4>505 HTTP Version Not Supported</h4>
                    <p>The server does not support the HTTP protocol version used in the request.[65]</p></li>
                <li><h4>506 Variant Also Negotiates (RFC 2295)</h4>
                    <p>Transparent content negotiation for the request results in a circular reference.[66]</p></li>
                <li><h4>507 Insufficient Storage (WebDAV; RFC 4918)</h4>
                    <p>The server is unable to store the representation needed to complete the request.[17]</p></li>
                <li><h4>508 Loop Detected (WebDAV; RFC 5842)</h4>
                    <p>The server detected an infinite loop while processing the request (sent in lieu of 208 Already
                        Reported).</p></li>
                <li><h4>510 Not Extended (RFC 2774)</h4>
                    <p>Further extensions to the request are required for the server to fulfil it.[67]</p></li>
                <li><h4>511 Network Authentication Required (RFC 6585)</h4>
                    <p>The client needs to authenticate to gain network access. Intended for use by intercepting proxies
                        used to
                        control access to the network (e.g., "captive portals" used to require agreement to Terms of
                        Service
                        before granting full Internet access via a Wi-Fi hotspot).[56]</p></li>
